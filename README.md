# 🔐 Basic Message Encryption & Decryption

A simple project that demonstrates **encryption and decryption of messages** using basic cryptographic techniques. This project is designed for beginners to understand the concept of secure communication and how data can be converted into an unreadable format and then decrypted back to the original message.

---

## ✅ Features

* Encrypt any text message into a secure format
* Decrypt the encrypted message back to the original text
* Simple and lightweight implementation
* Beginner-friendly code structure
* Works on any modern browser (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Structure of the web page
* **CSS3** – Styling the UI
* **JavaScript** – Logic for encryption and decryption

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhisheklpu/Basic-Message-Encryption-or-Description.git
   ```
2. **Open `index.html` in any browser**
3. Enter your message and choose **Encrypt** or **Decrypt**

---

## 🧩 How It Works

* The project uses a **basic substitution or character shifting technique** (like Caesar Cipher) to encrypt text.
* Each character in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the ASCII table.
* The decryption process reverses this shift to recover the original text.

---

## 🎯 Example

```
Original Message: Hello
Encrypted Message: Ifmmp
Decrypted Message: Hello
```
